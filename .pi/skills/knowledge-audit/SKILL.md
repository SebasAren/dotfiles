  Review the staleness and usefulness of any agent-facing knowledge in the repo:
  rule files (`.claude/rules/`), AGENTS.md (at any depth), CONVENTIONS.md, README.md,
  and domain docs if present. Use this skill whenever the user wants to audit, clean
  up, or prune their knowledge base: "audit rules", "audit docs", "audit knowledge",
  "review rules for staleness", "clean up the rules", "are any docs outdated?",
  "prune old knowledge", "check if rules are still relevant", "knowledge audit",
  or any variation. Also trigger when the user says they're confused by a rule/doc
  that seems wrong — use that as the starting point for a broader audit.

# Knowledge Audit

Audit every agent-facing knowledge file in the repo for staleness, accuracy, and usefulness. Stale knowledge is worse than no knowledge — it sends sessions in the wrong direction. Knowledge files include:

- `.claude/rules/*.md` — auto-injected rules
- `AGENTS.md` at any depth (root and per-package)
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — code-style source of truth
- `README.md` — human-facing but agents read it too
- `docs/domain/*.md` if the repo uses that pattern

## Scope Selection

When the user triggers this skill, determine scope:

| User says                                              | Scope                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| "audit rules", "check rules", "review rules"           | `.claude/rules/` only                          |
| "audit docs", "check docs", "review docs"              | `docs/**` and `*.md` reference docs only       |
| "audit AGENTS", "audit conventions"                    | Just the named file(s)                         |
| "audit knowledge", "audit everything", "full audit"    | All knowledge files (default for ambiguous)    |

When in doubt prefer the full audit — partial scopes miss cross-file contradictions, which is where most rot lives.

## Audit Process

### Step 1: Enumerate files

Discover all knowledge files in scope. Don't hardcode paths — find them:

```bash
# Rules
ls .claude/rules/ 2>/dev/null

# AGENTS.md at any depth (root + per-package)
fd -t f '^AGENTS\.md$' || find . -name AGENTS.md -not -path '*/node_modules/*'

# Convention / readme / domain docs at the root and one level down
ls CONVENTIONS.md README.md 2>/dev/null
fd -t f '^(CONVENTIONS|README)\.md$' --max-depth 3 || find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name CONVENTIONS.md -o -name README.md \)
ls docs/domain/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Audit each file

For **each file**, load it with `read` and run through the [Audit Checklist](#audit-checklist). Record findings — don't rely on memory.

Process files in parallel groups where possible (multiple `read` calls in parallel, then process each).

### Step 3: Cluster findings by topic, then prioritize

Before listing findings file-by-file, **cluster them by topic across files**. Per-file audits catch each instance of rot in isolation; topical clustering reveals the systemic issue.

Example: if "git hooks" appears in `README.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, and `AGENTS.md` and they contradict each other, that's one finding ("git-hooks knowledge is incoherent — pick one truth"), not three.

Then categorize:

Categorize all findings:

| Category           | Severity      | Action                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CONTRADICTION**  | 🔴 Critical   | Rule/doc says X, code does Y. Must fix.                              |
| **DEAD REFERENCE** | 🔴 Critical   | References a file/API/config that no longer exists                   |
| **OBSOLETE**       | 🟡 Warning    | Feature was removed, pattern is no longer used, convention changed   |
| **DUPLICATE**      | 🟡 Warning    | Two files say essentially the same thing — merge or remove           |
| **STALE EXAMPLE**  | 🟡 Warning    | Code example uses deprecated APIs or old patterns                    |
| **VAGUE**          | 🟢 Suggestion | Too abstract to be useful — needs concrete examples or should be cut |
| **BLOAT**          | 🟢 Suggestion | Large file where most content is unused — trim or split              |
| **HEALTHY**        | ✅ No action  | Current, accurate, and useful                                        |

If findings are extensive, prioritize the 🔴 Critical items first when presenting.

### Step 4: Present findings

Show the audit summary grouped by file:

```markdown
## Knowledge Audit — [Rules | Docs | Rules & Docs]

| File               | Status            | Finding                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `rules/auth.md`    | 🔴 Contradiction  | Says tokens expire in 24h, actual code uses 1h     |
| `rules/testing.md` | ✅ Healthy        | Up to date and referenced during work              |
| `docs/old-api.md`  | 🔴 Dead reference | References `/api/v1/` endpoint removed in refactor |
```

Files with no issues still get a row marked ✅ Healthy so the user sees what was checked.

### Step 5: Propose actions

For each non-healthy finding, propose a specific action:

- **Fix**: Edit the file to match reality (show the before/after)
- **Archive**: Move to `docs/archive/` or `docs/domain/archive/` with a date stamp
- **Merge**: Combine two similar files into one
- **Delete**: Remove entirely (for files where nothing is salvageable)
- **Trim**: Cut outdated sections, leave the good parts

## Audit Checklist

Apply these checks to every file:

### 🔍 Contradiction checks

- Does the file describe APIs, configs, or patterns that contradict what the codebase actually does?
- Cross-reference: `grep` for symbols, file paths, or API names mentioned in the file. Do they still exist?
- Check env vars, config keys, command names, and file paths — these are the most likely to drift.

### 🔍 Dead reference checks

- Does the file reference other files, modules, or directories that no longer exist?
- Does it mention env vars, npm packages, or CLI tools that have been removed?
- For every `mise run X` mentioned, verify the task exists with `mise tasks ls` (or `ls .mise/tasks/`). Renamed tasks are a common rot source.
- For every shell command (`bunx tsc --noEmit`, `npx X`, etc.), verify it still matches the project's actual workflow — these often go stale when a task runner replaces direct CLI calls.

### 🔍 Obsolete pattern checks

- Does the file describe a pattern that's been replaced by a newer convention?
- Check for deprecated Vue/Nuxt/Prisma/tRPC patterns: Nuxt 2 syntax, Options API, Prisma 4→5 migrations, deprecated test framework patterns.
- Compare against the actual codebase — search for the described pattern and see if it's still used.

### 🔍 Duplicate checks

- Is any content substantially duplicated across knowledge files? Check **all axes**, not just rules-vs-docs:
  - `.claude/rules/global.md` ↔ `AGENTS.md` ↔ `CONVENTIONS.md` (code-style sections often triplicated)
  - Root `AGENTS.md` ↔ subdirectory `AGENTS.md` (per the docs-structure rule, subdirectories must not duplicate global info)
  - `README.md` ↔ `AGENTS.md` (setup steps and tool tables drift apart)
- Duplicates create maintenance debt — when one gets updated and the other doesn't, they contradict.
- When a duplicate is found, identify which file should be the **source of truth** and reduce the others to a one-line link.

### 🔍 Example freshness checks

- Code examples: Do the APIs shown still exist in the current versions?
- Shell commands: Do they still work?
- Config snippets: Still valid syntax?

### 🔍 Usefulness checks

- Would this file actually help a future session? Be honest.
- Is it too vague to act on? ("Always write tests" without specifics)
- Is it so large nobody will read it? (Flags for splitting or archiving)

### 🔍 Derivability checks (rule files only)

Rule files load into context on every matching session — every bullet must earn its load cost. For each bullet ask:

- **Could an agent learn this by reading one file?** If yes, the code is already authoritative; the bullet is duplicate documentation that will rot. Cut it.
- **Is this an external constraint not visible in code?** (env vars, CI quirks, version gates, vendor API limits, undocumented SDK shapes) → keep.
- **Is this a design decision whose absence would invite churn?** (e.g. "system prompt is declarative — no ALL CAPS register") → keep.
- **Is this just a snapshot of current implementation?** (scoring weights, regex captures, which fields a function reads) → cut. The code is the source of truth.

This is the same bar the commit skill applies when *adding* rules — apply it in reverse to existing bullets.

## Execution Guidelines

- **Be thorough but fair.** Don't flag minor style differences as contradictions. Focus on substantive accuracy issues.
- **Verify before flagging.** Before calling something a contradiction, actually check the code. Don't guess.
- **Cite evidence.** When flagging an issue, cite the specific line in the rule/doc AND the actual code that contradicts it.
- **Respect file roles.** Rules (`.claude/rules/`) are auto-injected and pay context cost on every load — apply the derivability bar. AGENTS.md is the agent-facing index/overview. CONVENTIONS.md is the per-language source of truth. README.md is human-facing setup. Docs (`docs/domain/`) are deep reference. Each role implies what *should* live there and what shouldn't.
- **Check cross-references.** Rules often say "read `docs/domain/X.md` before implementing." Verify those docs exist and are current.
- **Batch reads.** When reading multiple files, do it in parallel — don't read one at a time unnecessarily.
- **Synthesize across files, don't just summarize per file.** A bullet that's stale in one file is often stale in two more. The topical pass in Step 3 is where systemic rot becomes visible.

## Applying Changes

After presenting findings, ask the user which actions to take. Apply approved changes:

- **Edits**: Use `edit` to update in place — keep diffs minimal and precise
- **Archives**: Move files with `mv`, preserving the original date
- **Merges**: Use `write` for the consolidated file, then remove the originals
- **Deletes**: Use `rm` (or `git rm` for tracked files) only after explicit user approval

Present all changes before applying. Wait for user confirmation.

### Commit hygiene

Don't bundle the whole audit into one mega-diff. Make **one atomic commit per finding category** so each is reviewable and revertable independently. Typical breakdown:

- One commit per dead-reference cluster (e.g. "remove stale git-hooks references across README/CONVENTIONS/AGENTS")
- One commit per consolidation (e.g. "make CONVENTIONS.md the single source for code style")
- One commit per file deletion or archive
- One commit per content restoration (if you're un-doing a previous over-trim)

Use `wt step commit --yes` between groups, or stage selectively with `git add <files>` before each commit.
