Linux workstation config, managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for symlink-based installation.

Includes [Pi agent extensions](#pi-agent-extensions) that delegate codebase exploration and documentation lookup to cheaper models via subagents, and write notes to an Obsidian wiki between sessions.

## Prerequisites

- **OS**: Linux (Fedora/RHEL preferred)
- **Shell**: Bash 4+
- **Git**: 2.30+
- **Homebrew** (Linuxbrew): installed to `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/`

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install runtimes with mise

```bash
mise install
```

This installs Python 3.12, Lua 5.4, Node, Bun, and tooling (ruff, StyLua, shellcheck, prettier) as defined in `mise.toml`.

### 2. Stow packages into `~/.config/`

GNU Stow creates symlinks from the repo to your home directory. Each top-level directory is a "package."

```bash
# Install specific tools
stow kitty nvim bashrc

# Install everything
stow */

# Dry run (see what would be linked)
stow -n nvim

# Uninstall a package
stow -D nvim
```

**How it works**: Stow mirrors the directory structure. `nvim/.config/nvim/` gets symlinked to `~/.config/nvim/`, so edits in the repo take effect immediately.

### 3. Set up Neovim

```bash
# Install plugins (headless)
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
```

LSP servers are managed by Mason (`:Mason` in Neovim). The config auto-installs servers on first use.

### 4. Set up shell secrets

Secrets (API keys) are resolved lazily via [Proton Pass CLI](https://proton.me/pass). Install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://proton.me/download/pass-cli/install.sh | bash
```

Then create `~/.secrets.tpl` from the template:

```bash
cp bashrc/.secrets.tpl ~/.secrets.tpl
# Edit to add your API keys
```

Secrets are only resolved when tools like `pi` or `nvim` actually need them — not on shell startup.

### 5. Install (legacy) Tmux plugins

On first launch, TPM auto-installs. If it doesn't:

```
prefix + I    # (Ctrl+a, then Shift+i)
```

Note: Kitty is the preferred terminal; tmux is kept for SSH fallback sessions only.

## Pi Agent Extensions

Custom extensions for the [Pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) coding assistant, written in TypeScript/Bun. Each extension is a self-contained module registering tools, commands, and TUI renderers.

> **Full documentation**: [`pi/.pi/README.md`](pi/.pi/README.md)

### Extension Overview

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **explore** | Subagent-powered codebase reconnaissance with pre-search, file indexing, and semantic reranking |
| **librarian** | Documentation research subagent (Exa web search + Context7 library docs + personal wiki) |
| **wiki-stash** | Persist conversation knowledge to Obsidian wiki without interrupting the session |
| **fuzzy-edit** | Tab-aware fuzzy fallback for the edit tool |
| **wiki-search** | Hybrid BM25 + vector search with Cohere reranking over personal wiki |
| **wiki-read** | Scope-safe wiki page reader |
| **wiki-lint** | Structural health checks for the wiki |
| **todo** | Todo management with state persisted in session entries |
| **plan-mode** | Read-only mode toggleable via `/plan` |
| **tdd-tree** | TDD kickoff point labeling in the session tree |
| **context7** | Up-to-date library documentation lookup |
| **exa-search** | Web search and page fetch via Exa API |
| **git-checkpoint** | Git stash checkpoints at each turn |
| **claude-rules** | `.claude/rules/` parser with picomatch glob matching |
| **cache-control** | LLM cache hint injection |
| **cheap-clarify** | Cheap-model clarification subagent |
| **extract-share** | Extract and share assistant messages as PNG or markdown |

### Explore Subagent Architecture

The explore extension combines query planning, in-memory file indexing, semantic reranking, and a read-only subagent to answer codebase questions.

```
User query
  │
  ├─► Query Planner ─► intent (define|use|arch|change) + entities + scope hints
  │
  ├─► File Index (LRU-cached, per repo)
  │     ├─ git ls-files → symbol extraction → import graph
  │     └─ Multi-signal heuristic scoring
  │
  ├─► Cohere Reranker (synthetic docs, no raw content)
  │     └─ Tiered results: Highly (≥60%) / Probably (≥30%) / Mentioned (≥10%)
  │
  └─► Subagent (read-only: read, grep, find, ls, bash)
        └─ Structured output: Files Retrieved / Key Code / Summary
```

Supports parallel exploration (up to 4×), scout-then-deepen patterns, and real-time index invalidation on edits.

**Example:**

```
> explore "how does the explore extension build its file index?"

[PRE-SEARCH RESULTS]
Query analysis: arch | entities: explore, extension, index | scope: extensions/explore

## Highly Relevant (read these first)
1. `./explore/index.ts` — score 92% — exact entity: explore
2. `./shared/src/subagent.ts` — score 67% — import proximity

## Summary
The explore extension builds an in-memory file index using `git ls-files`,
extracts symbols via Tree-sitter AST parsing, and builds a reverse import graph
for proximity scoring...
```

See [`pi/.pi/README.md`](pi/.pi/README.md) for the full architecture deep-dive, design decisions, and development guide.

## Architecture Decisions

### Why GNU Stow?

Stow is minimal and transparent — it just creates symlinks. No daemons, no complex state. The directory structure _is_ the config. This means:
- Git tracks everything naturally
- No build step or compilation
- Easy to add/remove packages (`stow -D pkg`)
- Works with any XDG-compliant tool

### Why mise instead of asdf/nvm/pyenv?

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is a single tool that replaces multiple version managers (nvm, pyenv, rbenv, etc.). It's fast, supports `.tool-versions` compatibility, and has built-in task running (`mise run format-lua`).

### Why Proton Pass for secrets?

Secrets should never be committed to git. Proton Pass CLI provides encrypted secret injection via templates (`~/.secrets.tpl`). The lazy resolution pattern in `.bashrc.d/secrets` means API keys are only fetched when a tool actually needs them, keeping shell startup fast.

### Why jj (jujutsu)?

[jj](https://jj-vcs.dev/) is a version control system that works as extra porcelain on top of git. It provides:
- Automatic operation logging with `jj undo`
- Immutable history with automatic commit evolution (no manual rebasing)
- Simpler mental model — revisions instead of branches
- Conventional commits generated via Pi LLM
- Pre-commit hook runs `mise run pre-commit` automatically

### Why subagents for exploration and research?

Running the main model (e.g. Claude) to grep through files burns tokens on output the parent doesn't need to see. The explore and librarian subagents delegate to a cheaper model (configurable via `CHEAP_MODEL`) with a focused toolset, returning a structured summary instead of raw tool output. This keeps the parent's context smaller and cuts token cost on reconnaissance work — the exact savings depend on model choice and query.

## Tool Details

### Neovim

→ **[Full details in `nvim/README.md`](nvim/README.md)**

Lazy.nvim with 15 LSP servers, blink.cmp completion (Codestral + Minuet-AI), conform.nvim formatting, nvim-dap debugging, and CodeCompanion.nvim AI coding.

### Tmux (Legacy)

→ **[Full details in `tmux/README.md`](tmux/README.md)**

Alt-based daily keybindings (no prefix for common ops), vi copy mode with `wl-copy`, Tokyo Night theme.

### Kitty

→ **[Full details in `kitty/README.md`](kitty/README.md)**

GPU-accelerated terminal that replaces both Ghostty and tmux. Provides native tabs/splits (no prefix needed — all Alt-based like tmux), Tokyo Night theme, and **native Kitty Graphics Protocol support** which makes pi inline images work without passthrough hacks.

### Shell (Bash)

Modular config in `bashrc/.bashrc.d/`. Each file handles one concern:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config` | Editor, fzf bindings |
| `alias` | Short aliases |
| `mise` | Activate mise runtime manager |
| `secrets` | Lazy Proton Pass integration |
| `tmux` | Auto-attach/create tmux sessions (skipped inside Kitty) |

| `fnox` | fnox reencryption helper |



### Homebrew

Personal Homebrew packages tracked in a Brewfile, synced between machines via `brew-sync` (stowed to `~/.local/bin/`):

```bash
brew-sync              # export: regenerate Brewfile from installed packages
brew-sync install     # import: install packages from Brewfile
brew-sync full        # both: regenerate + install
```

On Bluefin, system packages from `/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/*.Brewfile` are excluded automatically.

### jj (jujutsu)

Version control as extra porcelain on top of git. Config at `jj/.config/jj/config.toml`.

**Commit messages**: Generated by the Pi LLM via the commit skill, which feeds the diff to pi with conventional commit format instructions. Falls back to a simple `chore: update N files` if pi fails.

**Workflow**: `jj new` per TDD step, `jj commit` at step end, squash all revisions into one feature commit at plan end.

## Development

### Linting and Formatting

Run via mise tasks:

```bash
mise run format-lua     # Format Lua with StyLua
mise run lint-lua       # Lint Lua with luacheck
mise run format-python  # Format Python with ruff
mise run lint-python    # Lint Python with ruff
mise run lint-shell     # Lint shell scripts with shellcheck
```

### Testing

The TypeScript surface (Pi agent extensions and standalone CLIs) is covered by **535 tests across 49 files**, all running under [`bun test`](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test) and executed on every push by GitHub Actions (see [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml)).

| Location | Tests | Style |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `pi/.pi/agent/extensions/**/*.test.ts` | 471 | Unit tests co-located with source; `integration.test.ts` per extension covers load/register cycles |
| `pi/.local/bin/tdd-plan.test.ts` | 5 | End-to-end CLI tests via `execSync` against the `tdd-plan` binary |
| `pi/.local/bin/store-memory*.test.ts` | 18 | CLI tests for the `store-memory` skill binary |
| `obsidian/.local/lib/wiki-search/wiki-search.test.ts` | 41 | Unit tests with real filesystem fixtures for the `wiki-search` CLI |

**Run locally:**

```bash
# Pi extensions (typecheck + tests)
cd pi/.pi/agent/extensions
for dir in */; do [ -f "$dir/tsconfig.json" ] && npx tsc --noEmit -p "$dir/tsconfig.json"; done
bun test --parallel

# Standalone CLIs
bun test pi/.local/bin/tdd-plan.test.ts
bun test obsidian/.local/lib/wiki-search/wiki-search.test.ts
```

**Mocking conventions**: External SDKs (`exa-js`, `@upstash/context7-sdk`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`) are mocked via shared factories in `pi/.pi/agent/extensions/shared/src/test-mocks.ts` — tests never hit the network and need no API keys. See `.claude/rules/pi-extensions.md` for the full rationale.

### Pre-commit Checks

Run `mise run pre-commit` before committing — it executes format + lint + typecheck + tests. The git pre-commit hook (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) invokes it automatically on `jj commit`.
